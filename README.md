üìö Project Overview
This project involves two main components:

News Classifier: A machine learning model designed to classify news articles as either "FAKE" or "TRUE" based on their content.

COVID-19 Data Analysis: An analysis of COVID-19 cases across different regions, including visualizations and forecasting.

Installation üíª
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system along with several libraries. Here's how you can install them:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk plotly fbprophet
For the news classifier, ensure you have the nltk stopwords downloaded:

python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
Usage üîç
News Classifier
Clone the repository.

Run the news_classifier.py script to train and test the model.

Use the predict function to classify new sentences.

COVID-19 Data Analysis
Clone the repository.

Run the covid_analysis.py script to load and visualize COVID-19 data.

Use the Prophet library for forecasting.

News Classifier
Description
This component uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to classify news articles based on their content. It combines the title, text, and source of each article to make predictions.

How It Works
Data Preparation: The script loads a dataset of labeled news articles.

Feature Extraction: It uses CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical features.

Model Training: Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes model on the prepared data.

Prediction: Uses the trained model to predict the label of new, unseen articles.

COVID-19 Data Analysis
Description
This part of the project analyzes COVID-19 case data from various regions. It includes visualizations of case trends and forecasts future cases using the Prophet library.

How It Works
Data Loading: Loads COVID-19 case data from CSV files.

Data Visualization: Uses Plotly to create interactive plots of case trends.

Forecasting: Utilizes the Prophet library to predict future case numbers.
